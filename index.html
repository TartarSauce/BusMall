<!-- - The user interface needs to be clean
- The task on hand should be clearly described to the user with easy to follow directions
- The flow of the survey should be intuitive to the user once the directions are provided
- Appropriate feedback should be provided when necessary to ensure that the user does not stray from the task
- will be nice to tell the user how many more sets to go
- Report to the user when done with the survey -->
